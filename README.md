# Teensy-4.1-CAN-Bus
Learning to apply a simple CAN Bus using the Teensy 4.1.

This is a project associated with the USST (University of Saskatchewan Space Team) to explore
the possibility of using a CAN Bus on the rocketry project.

This particular project uses the Teensy 4.1 and the library FlexCAN T4 for a working prototype as well as the MCP2562 CAN Tranciever.
